                    breathe and avoid moisture damage. When wearing chiffon or georgette sarees, use a petticoat that

                <p>
                    Tip: <br>Select lehengas based on your body type.Choosing the right lehenga style can enhance your
                    natural shape and ensure you look your best. A-line lehengas, which flare out from the waist to form
                    an 'A' shape, create a balanced silhouette suitable for most body types. Fish-cut lehengas, which
                    hug the body till the knees and then flare out, accentuate curves and add a touch of glamour, making
                    them ideal for hourglass figures.

                <p>Trick: <br> Use a waist belt to adjust the length of your lehenga if it's too long, without needing
                    alterations. This also helps define your waist and adds a stylish accessory.</p>
